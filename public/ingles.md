# Tips for the English Section (EXANI-II)

The English section in the EXANI-II is typically diagnostic, meaning it measures your proficiency level but may not count towards your final admission score. However, it's always best to be prepared and do well. The section usually focuses on **reading comprehension** and **use of English**.

### 1. Reading Comprehension

You'll be given short texts (passages) and asked questions about them. The key is to understand the main idea, find specific details, and infer meaning.

**Common Question Types:**

-   **Main Idea:** "What is the main purpose of the text?" or "What is the best title for the passage?"
-   **Specific Information:** "According to the text, why did the company's sales increase?"
-   **Inference:** "What can be inferred about the author's opinion on the topic?" (The answer isn't stated directly).
-   **Vocabulary in Context:** "In line 5, the word 'it' refers to..." or "What is the meaning of the word 'remarkable' in this context?"

**Estrategia: Skim, Scan, and Read**
1.  **Skim:** Quickly read the first and last sentences of each paragraph to get the general topic.
2.  **Scan:** Read the questions first. Identify keywords in the questions (names, dates, specific terms).
3.  **Read:** Go back to the text and scan for those keywords. When you find one, read the surrounding sentences carefully to find the answer.

### 2. Use of English (Grammar and Vocabulary)

This part tests your knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary in context, often through fill-in-the-blank questions.

**Key Areas to Review:**

-   **Verb Tenses:** Be comfortable with Present Simple (`I work`), Present Continuous (`I am working`), Past Simple (`I worked`), Present Perfect (`I have worked`), and Future with "will" and "going to".
-   **Prepositions:** Words like *in*, *on*, *at*, *for*, *to*, *from*. They are tricky and depend on context.
    -   *Example:* You are **at** the university, **in** the classroom, sitting **on** a chair.
-   **Connectors:** Words that link ideas.
    -   *Contrast:* but, however, although
    -   *Cause/Effect:* so, therefore, because
    -   *Addition:* and, also, moreover
-   **Modals:** *can*, *could*, *should*, *must*, *may*, *might*.
    -   *Ability:* "I **can** speak English."
    -   *Advice:* "You **should** study every day."
-   **Phrasal Verbs & Idioms:** Common expressions.
    -   *Look for:* to search.
    -   *Give up:* to quit.
    -   *Break a leg:* Good luck!

**Mini Problema: Choose the Correct Word**
> **Question:** I have been studying psychology \_\_\_\_\_ three years.
> 1.  since
> 2.  **for**
> 3.  during
> 4.  at
>
> **Análisis:** "For" is used to talk about a duration of time (a period). "Since" is used to talk about a starting point in time (e.g., "since 2021").
> **Solución: 2**

**Consejo Final:** Don't panic. The English section is designed to be accessible. Use the process of elimination. If you don't know the answer, rule out the options that are clearly wrong. This increases your chances of guessing correctly. Good luck!
